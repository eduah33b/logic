					<h4>What We Do</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col l6 m6 s12">
					<p><b>Embroidery</b></p>
					<p>Don't want it printed? Our embroidery service is a computer-based process that uses multi-coloured thread to sew your custom design directly into the garment. For that hand-made, stitched look, our embroidery process has got you covered. With the minimum quantity for embroidered apparel at just 10 pieces for T shirts, it's easy to get the professional look you want for you. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col l6 m6 s12">
					<p><b>T-Shirt Printing</b></p>
					<p>Our traditional, expertly-handled, proven screen printing method accounts for over 90% of the T shirts we make at Logic. And with so many of our t-shirts produced through screen printing, you better believe we've got this process down. Screen printing involves creating a stencil (printers call this a "screen"), and then using that stencil to apply layers of ink on the printing surface. Each colour is applied using a unique stencil, one at a time, combined to achieve the final look. Screen printing is the best option for designs that require a high level of vibrancy, when printing on dark shirts, or specialty products. The ink in screen printing is applied thicker than digital printing, which results in brighter colours even on darker shirts. Ready to start? Custom Now</p>
